The Next.js App Router is a new way to build applications using the latest features of React. If you are already familiar with Next.js, you will recognize that the App Router is a natural evolution of the existing file-system-based [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages).

For new applications, we recommend using the App Router. For existing applications, you can [migrate to the App Router gradually](/docs/app-router/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration). It is also possible to use both routers within the same application.

This section describes the features available with the App Router.
